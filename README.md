# Project Name

## Description

This project is made to help practice Japanese handwriting. It utilizes both Java and Python to achieve its functionality. The Java part serves as the frontend, providing a user interface with fields for drawing symbols and buttons for interaction. Additionally, the Java portion handles the business logic, such as transferring data to the model, obtaining results, and launching the machine learning model. The project aims to facilitate Japanese handwriting practice by providing a user-friendly interface and accurate feedback on drawn symbols.

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.x.x)
- [pipenv](pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) (for managing Python dependencies)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Imb0duck/App.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd App
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies using `pipenv`:
    ```bash
    pipenv install
    ```

### Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `ImageEdit.java` file (e.g., `src/main/java/`).
3. Compile and run the `ImageEdit.java` file to launch our project. You should see a new window open.

### Project Structure

- **ML/**: Contains the machine learning model used for analyzing drawn symbols and providing feedback on handwriting accuracy.
- **src/main/java/**: Contains the Java source files responsible for the business logic of the application, including data transfer to the model, result retrieval, and model launching, and frontend part of the project,  including frontend components for drawing symbols and buttons.
